        <h1>Image Gallery </h1>
        <p>The concept of the image galleries is to present the visitor with the images, graphics and pictures created by the respective owner of the gallery.
             They are divided into several image albums, just like in a blog the posts are divided into categories. 
             This way the visitor can view just the images he is interested in.
             Each image album is presented to the user with a thumbnail, indicating the type of pictures,
             which are in it, and once inside the album, the images will once again be presented by thumbnails in order to allow for faster loading times and less traffic consumption.</p>
